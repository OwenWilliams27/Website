        <h2>Main Interests</h2>
        <p>
           I am a very <b>outdoorsy</b> type of person and that's one of the big reasons why I picked Western Washington University! 
           I own an electric bike and practically take it everywhere I can within reason. I am also a big runner and I try to get a least a mile or 2 everyday. 
           I enjoy hiking and exploring new environments and destinations. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I also enjoy <b>gaming</b> from time to time especially story telling games and rogue likes recently. 
            Ever since I built my first "gaming PC" in 9th grade after collecting some savings from working a grueling at the time, pool porter job at my neighborhood pool.
            This allowed me to dip my toes into a whole new world and helped spark my interest in Technology, not just gaming. Although mostly gaming at that time. 
            To name some specific games I've enjoyed Balatro, Stardew Valley, Slay the Spire, Deadlock, and Dredge.  
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>fitness</b>F and health have become a bigger focus in my life after rediscovering the impact of physical activity on my mental health and general clarity.
            Going to the gym is a nice refresh activity for me. I also love looking for new, easy, and healthy meals to prep and grocery shop for. 

        </p>

        <h2>Secondary Interests</h2>
        <p>
            I enjoy learning, rescuing, collecting, and taking care of house plants. I have a pretty massive fern, jade, a variety of succulents, and chinese money plant.

        </p>
        <p>
            I like drawing, painting, and designing random things. I originally entered college with an animation and illustration degree and in high school
            took a lot of classes to prepare for that. I ended up switching career paths for a few reasons but still really enjoy 
            artistic pursuits. 
        </p>
